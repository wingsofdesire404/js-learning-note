            <p> The most regrettable thing in my life

                for a lot of time I kept thinking by the time he throw me the question "whether should he quit the college".
                
                Somehow I  just gave him the most geniune anwer without a doubt: I told him that I really enjoyed the time preparing my 2nd college entrance exam. well, I did enjoyed it, cause all my friends by that time were very nice and easy to get alone with, for a quiet person like me, I treasured that kind of sweet relationship and  even 2 years later, I can't still help thinking that piece of old memories. One thing I knew about my life, or everybody's life is: when we looked back to the past and tried to revist that so called "golden era", behind that  whether simple of complex action, is that we can't undertake the tedious and unbearable situation that we are going through.
                
                When he asked me what was my 2nd life like, I told him that I enjoy it and hope the same friend, same life to occur in my future, which I know not the least probabilty would allow, also negeling the same pain in every exam, the same confusion of forgeting the knowledge. But the real problem is, same as me, he was also going through a trmendeous painful life, which invetibly caused him to pick up the idea about drop out the college. 
                
                Now I have to reconsider the awful suggestion I had provied him, what if I did not tell the good side of fleeting freedom, hopeful life that would never return again, insteed  what if I told him that I dislike the endless pressure and so called "life" is just a undeclinable event for people like us. Maybe if I use the 2nd phrase he would persist finishing college and get a bachelor's degree.
                
                But with no "if", when he was glancing inside of my eyes, he saw the my freedom and my ideal life. And he just dropped off.
                
                Before that, I dreamed thousands of times that he would come and join me, aiming for our dream together. Now he did, but I feel 100% regret. 
                
                I hate these gaming morons, they even can't let me finish the writing. waste a coup of coffee</p>
